## Application project structure

A simple project will look something like:

- `<PACKAGE_ROOT>/`: Directory in which the package manifest is located[^1].
    - `Cargo.toml`: Package manifest[^2] describing the binary crate that will be included in the
      app.
        - `src/`
            - `main.rs`: Conventional location for the executable[^3].
    - `LICENSE`: Open source acknowledgements[^4].
      If absent, it will be generated using [`cargo-about`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-about).
    - `manifest.json` Application manifest defining the app and its configuration[^5].
      If absent, the resulting artifact will be a plain executable instead of an EAP.
    - `html/`: Optional web client pages to include in the app[^6][^7].
    - `lib/`: Optional dynamically linked libraries to include in the app[^6][^7].
    - `additional-files/`: Optional additional files to include in the app[^7].

Some files and directories may be generated by a build script[^8] and placed in `<OUT_DIR>/`[^9] instead of in `<PACKAGE_ROOT>/`:

- `LICENSE`
- `manifest.json`
- `html/`
- `lib/`
- `additional-files/`

In addition to the above structure this tool makes the following assumptions:

- The package name (`package.name` in `Cargo.toml`) matches the app name (`acapPackageConf.setup.appName` in `manifest.json`).
- The package version (`package.version` in `Cargo.toml`) matches the app version (`acapPackageConf.setup.version` in `manifest.json`).
