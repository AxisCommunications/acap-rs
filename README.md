# ACAPRS

_Easy and safe ACAP Apps using Rust_


## Quickstart guide

For Linux like environments the ambition is that setting up a development environment should be as easy as

```bash
source ./init_env.sh
make sync_env
```

Important workflows are documented in the [Makefile](./Makefile) and can be listed with `make help`.


## Audience

This project is aimed at developing the platform.
For less opinionated advice on how to develop apps using the platform, check out the [examples].
