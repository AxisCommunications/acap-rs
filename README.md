## Getting started

The recommended setup is using the [dev container](#dev-container) and the most recent LTS version of AXIS OS [^1].

### Dev container

The quickest way to build the `hello_world` example is to launch the dev container and
run `make build AXIS_PACKAGE=hello_world`.
Once it completes there should be an `.eap` file in `target/acap`:

```console
$ ls -1 target/acap
hello_world_1_0_0_aarch64.eap
```

This works with any of the [example applications](#example-applications).

Important workflows are documented in the [Makefile](./Makefile) and can now be listed with
`make help`.

### Non-dev container

If you prefer to not use dev containers, or the implementation in your favorite IDE is buggy, the
app can be built using
only `docker`:

```sh
docker build --file .devcontainer/Dockerfile --tag acap-rs .
docker run \
  --interactive \
  --rm \
  --tty \
  --user $(id -u):$(id -g) \
  --volume $(pwd):$(pwd) \
  --workdir $(pwd) \
  acap-rs \
  make build AXIS_PACKAGE=hello_world
```

### Without container

Development environments outside containers are more difficult to reproduce and maintain.
Should it nonetheless be of interest, one procedure is documented
in [this workflow](.github/workflows/on-host-workflow.yml).

## Developer tools

Tools for developing ACAP apps are provided primarily as binary crates.
The tools can be roughly divided into low level _plumbing_ and high level _porcelain_.

All of these tools are installed in the dev container of this project.
To install them in another project before they are released, use the `--git` option e.g. like:

```sh
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-rs.git cargo-acap-sdk
```

### Porcelain programs

The focus of these tools are to make common things easy.

- `cargo-acap-sdk` - Automation of common development workflows.
  - Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Alpha
  - Documentation: [README](crates/cargo-acap-sdk/README.md)

### Plumbing programs

The focus of these tools are to make less common things possible.

- `acap-ssh-utils` - Utilities for interacting with Axis devices over SSH.
  - Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Alpha
  - Documentation: [README](crates/acap-ssh-utils/README.md)
- `cargo-acap-build`: Build utilities for ACAP apps and other executables deployed to Axis devices.
  - Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Alpha
  - Documentation: [README](crates/cargo-acap-build/README.md)
- `device-manager`: Utilities for manipulating a single Axis device.
  - Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Alpha
  - Documentation: [README](crates/device-manager/README.md)
- `fleet-manager`: Utilities for manipulating multiple Axis devices.
  - Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Alpha
  - Documentation: [README](crates/fleet-manager/README.md)

These can be installed independently and are provided as library crates too for developers who want
to write their own,
tailored tools.

## Libraries

To make it easier to relate the Rust offering to the official offering, the library crates are
grouped in a similar way as in the ACAP Native SDK APIs documentation.

> [!NOTE]
> If an API that is important to you is missing, create or upvote the feature request for it.

### ACAP Native API bindings

These are idiomatic and safe bindings for the [C APIs](https://axiscommunications.github.io/acap-documentation/docs/api/native-sdk-api.html#native-sdk-api).
Each crate has a corresponding `*-sys`, which is omitted for brevity.

- `axparameter`: Bindings for the Parameter API.

  - Status: üí° Started
  - Documentation: [Pull request](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-rs/pull/153)

### VAPIX API bindings

All the VAPIX APIs are provided by a single crate:

- `acap-vapix`: Bindings for various VAPIX APIs + credentials lookup.
  - Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Alpha
  - Documentation: [README](crates/acap-vapix/README.md)

### Other library crates

These are not closely related to any official APIs but may nonetheless be helpful in their own way:

- `acap-logging`: Logging utilities for ACAP applications
  - Status: üöß Beta
  - Documentation: [Docs.rs](https://docs.rs/acap-logging/latest/acap_logging/)

## Documentation

Ideally information is provided when and where the reader needs it, such as:

- Tab completions and help texts for binaries.
- Docstrings and doctests for libraries.

This is however not always suitable, and this section lists other sources of documentation provided
by this project.

## Troubleshooting

The docker image may fail to build with the following included in the output:
`/usr/bin/env: 'sh\r': No such file or directory`
This is likely caused by `git` replacing POSIX newlines with Windows newlines in which case it can
be resolved by either

- cloning the code in Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), or
- reconfiguring `git`.

## Related projects

This is not the only initiative to facilitate building Rust applications for Axis devices.
Below is a survey of other projects known to the author.

### cargo-acap

[cargo-acap] is a Rust binary crate that cross-compiles and packages Rust programs for Axis devices.
Installing it and building eap files for virtually every architecture can be done like
```sh
cargo install cargo-acap
cargo acap build
```

Praises
* Depends only on Cargo et al and Docker.
* Requires no ACAP specific boilerplate.
* Supports old products, including ARTPEC-4 and ARTPEC-5.

Reasonable complaints
* Unaware of the ACAP manifest.
  * Does not validate the ACAP manifest.
  * Requires information to be duplicated in `Cargo.toml` if the ACAP manifest is to be used.
  * Does not use dynamic user.
* Requires Docker
  * Cannot easily be used from within a Docker container.
* The default docker image cannot be used to link the ACAP SDK APIs.
* Assumes custom target triples with the vendor set to `axis`.
  * Restricts how docker images can be built.
  * May cause bugs in crates that use conditional compilation[^1].
* Does not support workspace projects
* Does not support bundling target-specific files[^2].

Unreasonable complaints
* Does not facilitate any interaction with the device including
  * compiling and running tests
  * installing the built `.eap` file
