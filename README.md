This repo is home to a mixture of developer tools, libraries, and documentation.

## Getting started

### Dev container

The quickest way to build the `hello_world` example is to launch the dev container and
run `make build AXIS_PACKAGE=hello_world`.
Once it completes there should be an `.eap` file in `target/acap`:

```console
$ ls -1 target/acap
hello_world_1_0_0_aarch64.eap
```

This works with any of the [example applications](#example-applications).

Important workflows are documented in the [Makefile](./Makefile) and can now be listed with
`make help`.

### Non-dev container

If you prefer to not use dev containers, or the implementation in your favorite IDE is buggy, the
app can be built using
only `docker`:

```sh
docker build --file .devcontainer/Dockerfile --tag acap-rs .
docker run \
  --interactive \
  --rm \
  --tty \
  --user $(id -u):$(id -g) \
  --volume $(pwd):$(pwd) \
  --workdir $(pwd) \
  acap-rs \
  make build AXIS_PACKAGE=hello_world
```

### Without container

Development environments outside containers are more difficult to reproduce and maintain.
Should it nonetheless be of interest, one procedure is documented
in [this workflow](.github/workflows/on-host-workflow.yml).

## Binary crates

Tools for developing ACAP apps are provided primarily as the following binary crates:.
The tools can be roughly divided into low level _plumbing_ and high level _porcelain_.

### Porcelain programs

- `cargo-acap-sdk` - Automation of common development workflows.
  - Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Alpha
  - Documentation: [README](crates/cargo-acap-sdk/README.md)

### Plumbing programs

- `acap-ssh-utils` - Utilities for interacting with Axis devices over SSH.
  - Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Alpha
  - Documentation: [README](crates/acap-ssh-utils/README.md)
- `cargo-acap-build`: Build utilities for ACAP apps and other executables deployed to Axis devices.
  - Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Alpha
  - Documentation: [README](crates/cargo-acap-build/README.md)
- `device-manager`: Utilities for manipulating a single Axis device.
  - Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Alpha
  - Documentation: [README](crates/device-manager/README.md)
- `fleet-manager`: Utilities for manipulating multiple Axis devices.
  - Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Alpha
  - Documentation: [README](crates/fleet-manager/README.md)

These can be installed independently and are provided as library crates too for developers who want
to write their own,
tailored tools.

## Library crates

To make it easier to relate the Rust offering to the official offering, the library crates are
grouped in a similar way as in the ACAP Native SDK APIs documentation.

> [!NOTE]
> If an API that is important to you is missing, create or upvote the feature request for it.

### ACAP Native API bindings

Idiomatic and safe bindings for official APIs.

- `axevent`: Bindings for the Event API.
  - Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Alpha
- `axstorage`: Bindings for the Edge Storage API.
  - Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Alpha
- `bbox`: Bindings for the Bounding Box API.
  - Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Alpha
- `licensekey`: Bindings for the License Key API.
  - Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Alpha
- `mdb`: Bindings for the Message Broker API.
  - Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Alpha

### VAPIX API bindings

- `acap-vapix`: Bindings for various VAPIX APIs + credentials lookup.
  - Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Alpha
  - Documentation: [README](crates/acap-vapix/README.md)

### Other library crates

These are not closely related to any official APIs but may nonetheless be helpful in their own way:

- `acap-logging`: Logging utilities for ACAP applications
  - Status: üöß Beta
  - Documentation: [Docs.rs](https://docs.rs/acap-logging/latest/acap_logging/)

## Documentation

Ideally information is provided when and where the reader needs it, such as:

- Tab completions and help texts for binaries.
- Docstrings and doctests for libraries.

This is however not always suitable, and this section lists other sources of documentation provided
by this project.

### Example applications

- `axstorage_example`: Writes data to files on all connected storages.
  - Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Alpha
  - [Source code](apps/axstorage_example/src/main.rs)
- `bounding_box_example`: Draws simple overlays in video streams.
  - Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Alpha
  - [Source code](apps/bounding_box_example/src/main.rs)
- `consume_analytics_metadata`: Subscribes to _analytics scene description_ data using `mdb`.
  - Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Alpha
  - [Source code](apps/consume_analytics_metadata/src/main.rs)
- `embedded_web_page`: Bundles an embedded web page.
  - Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Alpha
  - [Source code](apps/embedded_web_page/src/main.rs)
- `hello_world`:Sets up and uses logging using common functions and `acap-logging`.
  - Status: üöß Beta
  - [Source code](apps/hello_world/src/main.rs)
- `licensekey_handler`:Checks if an app is licensed using `licensekey`.
  - Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Alpha
  - [Source code](apps/licensekey_handler/src/main.rs)
- `reverse_proxy`: Exposes HTTP and WebSocket APIs using a `axum` and reverse proxy configuration.
  - Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Alpha
  - [Source code](apps/reverse_proxy/src/main.rs)
- `send_event`: Sends events using `axevent`.
  - Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Alpha
  - [Source code](apps/send_event/src/main.rs)
- `using_a_build_script`: Generates html, lib and app manifest files using a build script.
  - Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Alpha
  - [Source code](apps/using_a_build_script/src/main.rs)
- `vapix_access`: Accesses VAPIX APIs using `acap-vapix`.
  - Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Alpha
  - [Source code](apps/vapix_access/src/main.rs)

<!-- inspect_env is omitted because it is intended primarily as a test -->

## Troubleshooting

The docker image may fail to build with the following included in the output:
`/usr/bin/env: 'sh\r': No such file or directory`
This is likely caused by `git` replacing POSIX newlines with Windows newlines in which case it can
be resolved by either

- cloning the code in Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), or
- reconfiguring `git`.
