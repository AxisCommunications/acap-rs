## Development environment

1. Dev Container
   - A reproducible environment where everything _should_ work.
   - Expect help troubleshooting if something does not work.
2. Debian
   - Can do everything the dev container can do _if_ set up correctly.
   - In practice the best tested environment, but may not be fully documented.
   - Expect to do your own troubleshooting since it is not a reproducible environment.
3. Ubuntu
   - Some dependencies may not cross-compile.
4. MacOS
   - Cross compilation does not work.
5. WSL
6. Windows
