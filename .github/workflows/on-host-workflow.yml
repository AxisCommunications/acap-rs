    # This procedure should work on:
    # - Debian 12 on desktop.
    # - Ubuntu 22.04 on desktop.
    #
    # The setup is split into three parts:
    #
    # 1. Global setup: Steps that may have effects anywhere on the system.
    # 2. Local setup: Steps that have effects only in this project (and in caches).
    # 3. Shell setup: Steps that have effects only in the current shell.
    #
    # These steps are only suggestions and readers are welcome install dependencies in a different
    # way, or skip them entirely;
    # not every dependency is needed for every workflow and the way the `init_env.sh` file is
    # created should allow blending global and local installations as the user sees fit.
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Global setup
        # These steps typically need to be done once per machine, or when the project dependencies change.
        #
        # They are divided into multiple scripts to:
        # - run only what is needed as root.
        # - give the user insight into and control over how their system is configured.
        #
        # One prerequisite that is not documented explicitly below is Docker.
        #
        # More information about what each script does and why may be found in the script itself.
